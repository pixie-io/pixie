# PXL Scripts Overview

Pixie open sources all of its scripts, which serve as examples of scripting in the PxL language. To learn more about PxL, take a look at our [documentation](https://docs.pixielabs.ai/pxl).

## Contributing

If you want to contribute a new PxL script, please discuss your idea on a Github [issue](https://github.com/pixie-labs/pixie/issues). Since the scripts are exposed to all community users there is a comprehensive review process.

You can contribute a PxL script by forking our repo, adding a new script then creating a pull request. Once the script is accepted it will automatically deploy once the CI process completes.

To learn in more details, you can review this tutorial on [Contributing PxL Scripts](https://docs.pixielabs.ai/using-pixie/scripts/contributing-pxl-scripts/)
