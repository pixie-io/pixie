## We're in Private Beta!

Pixie is being built for broad use by the end of 2020.

As we build up Pixie, we are sharing our beta to get feedback from early adopters from within the developer community and our beta partner teams.

If you are interested in tinkering, you can [sign-up](https://withpixie.ai/) and join our [community on slack](https://join.slack.com/t/pixie-community/shared_invite/enQtODY3NjU5MTc4OTY0LTFhYjc3MWY1NDBkZTc5YTdjNzM0OGYxZmNmODU2MDE5NzYyN2Q1NmIxMmEyN2YwNmM5MjU4NGY2NDBjOWFjY2E).
