Pixie is being built to give engineers access to no-instrumentation, streaming & unsampled auto-telemetry to debug performance issues in real-time. 

Pixie's magical developer experience is enabled by three key design attributes:

1. **No Instrumentation Collection:** Full-body network requests (via eBPF), metrics, logs & events collected without the need for code-changes and at less than 5% overhead. 
2. **Edge Compute:**  Data storage and computation isolated within the customer's kubernetes cluster without the need to persist data outside the customer's environment.
3. **Command Driven Consumption:** Data and signals programmatically accessed via the Pixie UI or Pixie CLI which are powered by an expressive API. 

We're building up Pixie for broad use by the end of 2020 with an initial focus on Kubernetes workloads.

## Open Source

Along with building Pixie as a freemium SaaS product, contributing open and accessable projects to the broader developer community is integral to our roadmap. We currently contribute in two ways:

- **Open Sourced Pixie Platform Primitives:** We plan to open-source components of the Pixie Platform which can be independently useful to developers after our Beta. These include our Community Pxl Scripts, Pixie CLI, eBPF Collectors etc. If you are interested in contributing during our Beta, [email us](mailto:community@pixielabs.ai).
- **Unlimited Pixie Community Access:** Our [Pixie Community](https://work.withpixie.ai/) product is a completely free offering with all core features of the Pixie developer experience. We will invest in this offering for the long term to give developers across the world an easy and zero cost way to use Pixie.

## About Us

Founded in late 2018, we are a San Francisco based stealth machine intelligence startup. Our north star is to build a new generation of intelligent products which empower developers to engineer the future.

We're heads down building Pixie and excited to share it broadly with the community later this year.  If you're interested in learning more about us or in our current job openings, we'd love to [hear from you](mailto:info@pixielabs.ai).
