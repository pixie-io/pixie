_Engineers debug distributed applications live with Pixie’s no-config streaming telemetry._

## We are in Private Beta!

Pixie is being built for broad use by the end of the year.

In these early days, we’re very lucky to have a diverse and enthusiastic community of early adopters. Pixienauts, as we fondly refer to them, help shape the product, share expertise, host events, and much more.

If you are interested in tinkering with our beta, you can sign-up here and join our community on slack.


## Support

If you have a feature request or bug report, you file an issue to this repository. Here’s a few guidelines:

This issue tracker is only for Pixie Beta related issues, along with other services accessible from within it, including Pixie Docs.
If you  are facing other issues and/or you want to include personal information such as your username or collection names, then mail us at help@pixielabs.ai

Note: We are in the process of making this process exhaustive and super-helpful so bear with us as we build it up


## About Pixie

We are a San Francisco based stealth machine intelligence startup backed by Benchmark and GV. Pixie is used by engineers in teams like Hulu to debug distributed applications live, without changing code & moving data out. Our private beta is out for feedback, and we are building up the product for broad use by the end of 2020.
