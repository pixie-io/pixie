                              The maximum number of nodes with an existing available DaemonSet pod that
                              can have an updated DaemonSet pod during during an update.
                              Value can be an absolute number (ex: 5) or a percentage of desired pods (ex: 10%).
                              This can not be 0 if MaxUnavailable is 0.
                              Absolute number is calculated from percentage by rounding up to a minimum of 1.
                              Default value is 0.
                              Example: when this is set to 30%, at most 30% of the total number of nodes
                              that should be running the daemon pod (i.e. status.desiredNumberScheduled)
                              can have their a new pod created before the old pod is marked as deleted.
                              The update starts by launching new pods on 30% of nodes. Once an updated
                              pod is available (Ready for at least minReadySeconds) the old DaemonSet pod
                              on that node is marked deleted. If the old pod becomes unavailable for any
                              reason (Ready transitions to false, is evicted, or is drained) an updated
                              pod is immediatedly created on that node without considering surge limits.
                              Allowing surge implies the possibility that the resources consumed by the
                              daemonset on any given node can double if the readiness check fails, and
                              so resource intensive daemonsets should take into account that they may
                              cause evictions during disruption.

                              number of DaemonSet pods at the start of the update (ex: 10%). Absolute
                              number is calculated from percentage by rounding up.

                              can have their pods stopped for an update at any given time. The update
                              starts by stopping at most 30% of those DaemonSet pods and then brings
                              up new DaemonSet pods in their place. Once the new pods are available,
                              it then proceeds onto other DaemonSet pods, thus ensuring that at least
                              70% of original number of DaemonSet pods are available at all times during
                              the update.

                              of balancing the service traffic between nodes, and so each node will deliver
                              traffic only to the node-local endpoints of the service, without masquerading
                              the client source IP. (Traffic mistakenly sent to a node with no endpoints will
                              be dropped.) The default value, "Cluster", uses the standard behavior of

                              a NodePort from within the cluster may need to take traffic policy into account

                              Pods themselves are not. Agents which consume only Kubernetes generated endpoints
                              through the Endpoints or EndpointSlice resources can safely assume this behavior.

                              "ClusterIP" allocates a cluster-internal IP address for load-balancing
                              to endpoints. Endpoints are determined by the selector or if that is not
                              specified, by manual construction of an Endpoints object or

                              than a virtual IP.
                              "NodePort" builds on ClusterIP and allocates a port on every node which
                              routes to the same endpoints as the clusterIP.
                              "LoadBalancer" builds on NodePort and creates an external load-balancer
                              (if supported in the current cloud) which routes to the same endpoints
                              as the clusterIP.

                              a NodePort from within the cluster may need to take traffic policy into account

                              but should apply for any default implementation. If set, it is assumed that a load balancer
                              implementation is watching for Services with a matching class. Any default load balancer
                              implementation (e.g. cloud providers) should ignore Services that set this field.

                              "ClusterIP" allocates a cluster-internal IP address for load-balancing

                              than a virtual IP.
                              "NodePort" builds on ClusterIP and allocates a port on every node which

                              randomly. If an address is specified manually, is in-range (as per

                              a NodePort from within the cluster may need to take traffic policy into account

                              The primary use case for setting this field is for a StatefulSet's Headless Service to

                              Pods themselves are not. Agents which consume only Kubernetes generated endpoints
                              through the Endpoints or EndpointSlice resources can safely assume this behavior.

                              "ClusterIP" allocates a cluster-internal IP address for load-balancing
                              to endpoints. Endpoints are determined by the selector or if that is not
                              specified, by manual construction of an Endpoints object or
                              EndpointSlice objects. If clusterIP is "None", no virtual IP is
                              allocated and the endpoints are published as a set of endpoints rather
                              than a virtual IP.
                              "NodePort" builds on ClusterIP and allocates a port on every node which
                              routes to the same endpoints as the clusterIP.
                              "LoadBalancer" builds on NodePort and creates an external load-balancer
                              (if supported in the current cloud) which routes to the same endpoints
                              as the clusterIP.

                              Value can be an absolute number (ex: 5) or a percentage of desired pods (ex: 10%).
                              This can not be 0 if MaxUnavailable is 0.
                              Absolute number is calculated from percentage by rounding up to a minimum of 1.
                              Default value is 0.
                              Example: when this is set to 30%, at most 30% of the total number of nodes
                              that should be running the daemon pod (i.e. status.desiredNumberScheduled)
                              can have their a new pod created before the old pod is marked as deleted.
                              The update starts by launching new pods on 30% of nodes. Once an updated
                              pod is available (Ready for at least minReadySeconds) the old DaemonSet pod
                              on that node is marked deleted. If the old pod becomes unavailable for any
                              reason (Ready transitions to false, is evicted, or is drained) an updated
                              pod is immediatedly created on that node without considering surge limits.
                              Allowing surge implies the possibility that the resources consumed by the
                              daemonset on any given node can double if the readiness check fails, and
                              so resource intensive daemonsets should take into account that they may
                              cause evictions during disruption.

                              can have their pods stopped for an update at any given time. The update
                              starts by stopping at most 30% of those DaemonSet pods and then brings

                              of balancing the service traffic between nodes, and so each node will deliver
                              traffic only to the node-local endpoints of the service, without masquerading
                              the client source IP. (Traffic mistakenly sent to a node with no endpoints will
                              be dropped.) The default value, "Cluster", uses the standard behavior of

                              features). Note that traffic sent to an External IP or LoadBalancer IP from
                              within the cluster will always get "Cluster" semantics, but clients sending to
                              a NodePort from within the cluster may need to take traffic policy into account

                              loadBalancerClass is the class of the load balancer implementation this Service belongs to.
                              If specified, the value of this field must be a label-style identifier, with an optional prefix,
                              e.g. "internal-vip" or "example.com/internal-vip". Unprefixed names are reserved for end-users.
                              This field can only be set when the Service type is 'LoadBalancer'. If not set, the default load
                              balancer implementation is used, today this is typically done through the cloud provider integration,
                              but should apply for any default implementation. If set, it is assumed that a load balancer
                              implementation is watching for Services with a matching class. Any default load balancer
                              implementation (e.g. cloud providers) should ignore Services that set this field.
                              This field can only be set when creating or updating a Service to type 'LoadBalancer'.
                              Once set, it can not be changed. This field will be wiped when a service is updated to a non 'LoadBalancer' type.

                              This feature depends on whether the underlying cloud-provider supports specifying

                              This field will be ignored if the cloud-provider does not support the feature.

                              Using it is non-portable and it may not support dual-stack.

                              "ClusterIP" allocates a cluster-internal IP address for load-balancing
                              to endpoints. Endpoints are determined by the selector or if that is not
                              specified, by manual construction of an Endpoints object or

                              "NodePort" builds on ClusterIP and allocates a port on every node which
                              routes to the same endpoints as the clusterIP.
                              "LoadBalancer" builds on NodePort and creates an external load-balancer
                              (if supported in the current cloud) which routes to the same endpoints
                              as the clusterIP.

                              a NodePort from within the cluster may need to take traffic policy into account

                              The primary use case for setting this field is for a StatefulSet's Headless Service to

                              Pods themselves are not. Agents which consume only Kubernetes generated endpoints
                              through the Endpoints or EndpointSlice resources can safely assume this behavior.

                              "ClusterIP" allocates a cluster-internal IP address for load-balancing
                              to endpoints. Endpoints are determined by the selector or if that is not
                              specified, by manual construction of an Endpoints object or
                              EndpointSlice objects. If clusterIP is "None", no virtual IP is
                              allocated and the endpoints are published as a set of endpoints rather
                              than a virtual IP.
                              "NodePort" builds on ClusterIP and allocates a port on every node which
                              routes to the same endpoints as the clusterIP.
                              "LoadBalancer" builds on NodePort and creates an external load-balancer
                              (if supported in the current cloud) which routes to the same endpoints
                              as the clusterIP.

                                  if both fields are non-empty, they must have the same value. For backwards
                                  compatibility, when namespace isn't specified in dataSourceRef,

                                  value automatically if one of them is empty and the other is non-empty.

                                  dataSource isn't set to the same value and must be empty.
                                  There are three important differences between dataSource and dataSourceRef:
                                  * While dataSource only allows two specific types of objects, dataSourceRef
                                    allows any non-core object, as well as PersistentVolumeClaim objects.
                                  * While dataSource ignores disallowed values (dropping them), dataSourceRef
                                    preserves all values, and generates an error if a disallowed value is
                                    specified.
                                  * While dataSource only allows local objects, dataSourceRef allows objects
                                    in any namespaces.
                                  (Beta) Using this field requires the AnyVolumeDataSource feature gate to be enabled.
                                  (Alpha) Using the namespace field of dataSourceRef requires the CrossNamespaceVolumeDataSource feature gate to be enabled.

                          should be considered for eviction. Current implementation considers healthy pods,
                          as pods that have status.conditions item with type="Ready",status="True".

                          Valid policies are IfHealthyBudget and AlwaysAllow.
                          If no policy is specified, the default behavior will be used,
                          which corresponds to the IfHealthyBudget policy.

                          IfHealthyBudget policy means that running pods (status.phase="Running"),
                          but not yet healthy can be evicted only if the guarded application is not
                          disrupted (status.currentHealthy is at least equal to status.desiredHealthy).
                          Healthy pods will be subject to the PDB for eviction.

                          AlwaysAllow policy means that all running pods (status.phase="Running"),
                          but not yet healthy are considered disrupted and can be evicted regardless
                          of whether the criteria in a PDB is met. This means perspective running
                          pods of a disrupted application might not get a chance to become healthy.
                          Healthy pods will be subject to the PDB for eviction.

                          Additional policies may be added in the future.
                          Clients making eviction decisions should disallow eviction of unhealthy pods
                          if they encounter an unrecognized policy in this field.

                              of balancing the service traffic between nodes, and so each node will deliver
                              traffic only to the node-local endpoints of the service, without masquerading

                              features). Note that traffic sent to an External IP or LoadBalancer IP from
                              within the cluster will always get "Cluster" semantics, but clients sending to
                              a NodePort from within the cluster may need to take traffic policy into account

                              The primary use case for setting this field is for a StatefulSet's Headless Service to

                              "ClusterIP" allocates a cluster-internal IP address for load-balancing
                              to endpoints. Endpoints are determined by the selector or if that is not
                              specified, by manual construction of an Endpoints object or
                              EndpointSlice objects. If clusterIP is "None", no virtual IP is
                              allocated and the endpoints are published as a set of endpoints rather
                              than a virtual IP.
                              "NodePort" builds on ClusterIP and allocates a port on every node which
                              routes to the same endpoints as the clusterIP.
                              "LoadBalancer" builds on NodePort and creates an external load-balancer
                              (if supported in the current cloud) which routes to the same endpoints
                              as the clusterIP.

                              traffic only to the node-local endpoints of the service, without masquerading

                              a NodePort from within the cluster may need to take traffic policy into account

                              through the Endpoints or EndpointSlice resources can safely assume this behavior.

                              "ClusterIP" allocates a cluster-internal IP address for load-balancing
                              to endpoints. Endpoints are determined by the selector or if that is not
                              specified, by manual construction of an Endpoints object or

                              than a virtual IP.
                              "NodePort" builds on ClusterIP and allocates a port on every node which
                              routes to the same endpoints as the clusterIP.
                              "LoadBalancer" builds on NodePort and creates an external load-balancer
                              (if supported in the current cloud) which routes to the same endpoints
                              as the clusterIP.

                                  dataSourceRef specifies the object from which to populate the volume with data, if a non-empty
                                  volume is desired. This may be any object from a non-empty API group (non
                                  core object) or a PersistentVolumeClaim object.
                                  When this field is specified, volume binding will only succeed if the type of
                                  the specified object matches some installed volume populator or dynamic
                                  provisioner.
                                  This field will replace the functionality of the dataSource field and as such
                                  if both fields are non-empty, they must have the same value. For backwards
                                  compatibility, when namespace isn't specified in dataSourceRef,
                                  both fields (dataSource and dataSourceRef) will be set to the same
                                  value automatically if one of them is empty and the other is non-empty.
                                  When namespace is specified in dataSourceRef,
                                  dataSource isn't set to the same value and must be empty.
                                  There are three important differences between dataSource and dataSourceRef:
                                  * While dataSource only allows two specific types of objects, dataSourceRef
                                    allows any non-core object, as well as PersistentVolumeClaim objects.
                                  * While dataSource ignores disallowed values (dropping them), dataSourceRef
                                    preserves all values, and generates an error if a disallowed value is
                                    specified.
                                  * While dataSource only allows local objects, dataSourceRef allows objects
                                    in any namespaces.
                                  (Beta) Using this field requires the AnyVolumeDataSource feature gate to be enabled.
                                  (Alpha) Using the namespace field of dataSourceRef requires the CrossNamespaceVolumeDataSource feature gate to be enabled.

                          as pods that have status.conditions item with type="Ready",status="True".

                          Valid policies are IfHealthyBudget and AlwaysAllow.
                          If no policy is specified, the default behavior will be used,
                          which corresponds to the IfHealthyBudget policy.

                          IfHealthyBudget policy means that running pods (status.phase="Running"),
                          but not yet healthy can be evicted only if the guarded application is not
                          disrupted (status.currentHealthy is at least equal to status.desiredHealthy).
                          Healthy pods will be subject to the PDB for eviction.

                          AlwaysAllow policy means that all running pods (status.phase="Running"),
                          but not yet healthy are considered disrupted and can be evicted regardless
                          of whether the criteria in a PDB is met. This means perspective running
                          pods of a disrupted application might not get a chance to become healthy.
                          Healthy pods will be subject to the PDB for eviction.

                          Additional policies may be added in the future.
                          Clients making eviction decisions should disallow eviction of unhealthy pods
                          if they encounter an unrecognized policy in this field.

                              the service in a way that assumes that external load balancers will take care
                              of balancing the service traffic between nodes, and so each node will deliver
                              traffic only to the node-local endpoints of the service, without masquerading
                              the client source IP. (Traffic mistakenly sent to a node with no endpoints will
                              be dropped.) The default value, "Cluster", uses the standard behavior of
                              routing to all endpoints evenly (possibly modified by topology and other
                              features). Note that traffic sent to an External IP or LoadBalancer IP from
                              within the cluster will always get "Cluster" semantics, but clients sending to
                              a NodePort from within the cluster may need to take traffic policy into account
                              when picking a node.

                              "ClusterIP" allocates a cluster-internal IP address for load-balancing
                              to endpoints. Endpoints are determined by the selector or if that is not
                              specified, by manual construction of an Endpoints object or
                              EndpointSlice objects. If clusterIP is "None", no virtual IP is
                              allocated and the endpoints are published as a set of endpoints rather
                              than a virtual IP.
                              "NodePort" builds on ClusterIP and allocates a port on every node which
                              routes to the same endpoints as the clusterIP.
                              "LoadBalancer" builds on NodePort and creates an external load-balancer
                              (if supported in the current cloud) which routes to the same endpoints
                              as the clusterIP.
                              "ExternalName" aliases this service to the specified externalName.
                              Several other fields do not apply to ExternalName services.

                              of balancing the service traffic between nodes, and so each node will deliver
                              traffic only to the node-local endpoints of the service, without masquerading
                              the client source IP. (Traffic mistakenly sent to a node with no endpoints will
                              be dropped.) The default value, "Cluster", uses the standard behavior of

                              features). Note that traffic sent to an External IP or LoadBalancer IP from
                              within the cluster will always get "Cluster" semantics, but clients sending to
                              a NodePort from within the cluster may need to take traffic policy into account

                              The primary use case for setting this field is for a StatefulSet's Headless Service to

                              Pods themselves are not. Agents which consume only Kubernetes generated endpoints
                              through the Endpoints or EndpointSlice resources can safely assume this behavior.

                              "ClusterIP" allocates a cluster-internal IP address for load-balancing
                              to endpoints. Endpoints are determined by the selector or if that is not
                              specified, by manual construction of an Endpoints object or

                              than a virtual IP.
                              "NodePort" builds on ClusterIP and allocates a port on every node which
                              routes to the same endpoints as the clusterIP.
                              "LoadBalancer" builds on NodePort and creates an external load-balancer
                              (if supported in the current cloud) which routes to the same endpoints
                              as the clusterIP.

                              externalTrafficPolicy describes how nodes distribute service traffic they
                              receive on one of the Service's "externally-facing" addresses (NodePorts,
                              ExternalIPs, and LoadBalancer IPs). If set to "Local", the proxy will configure
                              the service in a way that assumes that external load balancers will take care
                              of balancing the service traffic between nodes, and so each node will deliver
                              traffic only to the node-local endpoints of the service, without masquerading
                              the client source IP. (Traffic mistakenly sent to a node with no endpoints will
                              be dropped.) The default value, "Cluster", uses the standard behavior of
                              routing to all endpoints evenly (possibly modified by topology and other
                              features). Note that traffic sent to an External IP or LoadBalancer IP from
                              within the cluster will always get "Cluster" semantics, but clients sending to
                              a NodePort from within the cluster may need to take traffic policy into account
                              when picking a node.

                              publishNotReadyAddresses indicates that any agent which deals with endpoints for this
                              Service should disregard any indications of ready/not-ready.
                              The primary use case for setting this field is for a StatefulSet's Headless Service to
                              propagate SRV DNS records for its Pods for the purpose of peer discovery.
                              The Kubernetes controllers that generate Endpoints and EndpointSlice resources for
                              Services interpret this to mean that all endpoints are considered "ready" even if the
                              Pods themselves are not. Agents which consume only Kubernetes generated endpoints
                              through the Endpoints or EndpointSlice resources can safely assume this behavior.

                              type determines how the Service is exposed. Defaults to ClusterIP. Valid
                              options are ExternalName, ClusterIP, NodePort, and LoadBalancer.
                              "ClusterIP" allocates a cluster-internal IP address for load-balancing
                              to endpoints. Endpoints are determined by the selector or if that is not
                              specified, by manual construction of an Endpoints object or
                              EndpointSlice objects. If clusterIP is "None", no virtual IP is
                              allocated and the endpoints are published as a set of endpoints rather
                              than a virtual IP.
                              "NodePort" builds on ClusterIP and allocates a port on every node which
                              routes to the same endpoints as the clusterIP.
                              "LoadBalancer" builds on NodePort and creates an external load-balancer
                              (if supported in the current cloud) which routes to the same endpoints
                              as the clusterIP.
                              "ExternalName" aliases this service to the specified externalName.
                              Several other fields do not apply to ExternalName services.

                              receive on one of the Service's "externally-facing" addresses (NodePorts,
                              ExternalIPs, and LoadBalancer IPs). If set to "Local", the proxy will configure
                              the service in a way that assumes that external load balancers will take care
                              of balancing the service traffic between nodes, and so each node will deliver
                              traffic only to the node-local endpoints of the service, without masquerading
                              the client source IP. (Traffic mistakenly sent to a node with no endpoints will
                              be dropped.) The default value, "Cluster", uses the standard behavior of
                              routing to all endpoints evenly (possibly modified by topology and other
                              features). Note that traffic sent to an External IP or LoadBalancer IP from
                              within the cluster will always get "Cluster" semantics, but clients sending to
                              a NodePort from within the cluster may need to take traffic policy into account
                              when picking a node.

                              The Kubernetes controllers that generate Endpoints and EndpointSlice resources for
                              Services interpret this to mean that all endpoints are considered "ready" even if the
                              Pods themselves are not. Agents which consume only Kubernetes generated endpoints
                              through the Endpoints or EndpointSlice resources can safely assume this behavior.

                              type determines how the Service is exposed. Defaults to ClusterIP. Valid
                              options are ExternalName, ClusterIP, NodePort, and LoadBalancer.
                              "ClusterIP" allocates a cluster-internal IP address for load-balancing
                              to endpoints. Endpoints are determined by the selector or if that is not
                              specified, by manual construction of an Endpoints object or
                              EndpointSlice objects. If clusterIP is "None", no virtual IP is
                              allocated and the endpoints are published as a set of endpoints rather
                              than a virtual IP.
                              "NodePort" builds on ClusterIP and allocates a port on every node which
                              routes to the same endpoints as the clusterIP.
                              "LoadBalancer" builds on NodePort and creates an external load-balancer
                              (if supported in the current cloud) which routes to the same endpoints
                              as the clusterIP.
                              "ExternalName" aliases this service to the specified externalName.
                              Several other fields do not apply to ExternalName services.

                                The primary use case for setting this field is for a StatefulSet's Headless Service to
                                propagate SRV DNS records for its Pods for the purpose of peer discovery.
                                The Kubernetes controllers that generate Endpoints and EndpointSlice resources for
                                Services interpret this to mean that all endpoints are considered "ready" even if the
                                Pods themselves are not. Agents which consume only Kubernetes generated endpoints
                                through the Endpoints or EndpointSlice resources can safely assume this behavior.

                                "ClusterIP" allocates a cluster-internal IP address for load-balancing
                                to endpoints. Endpoints are determined by the selector or if that is not

                                EndpointSlice objects. If clusterIP is "None", no virtual IP is
                                allocated and the endpoints are published as a set of endpoints rather
                                than a virtual IP.
                                "NodePort" builds on ClusterIP and allocates a port on every node which
                                routes to the same endpoints as the clusterIP.
                                "LoadBalancer" builds on NodePort and creates an external load-balancer
                                (if supported in the current cloud) which routes to the same endpoints
                                as the clusterIP.
                                "ExternalName" aliases this service to the specified externalName.
                                Several other fields do not apply to ExternalName services.

                            core object) or a PersistentVolumeClaim object.
                            When this field is specified, volume binding will only succeed if the type of
                            the specified object matches some installed volume populator or dynamic
                            provisioner.
                            This field will replace the functionality of the dataSource field and as such
                            if both fields are non-empty, they must have the same value. For backwards
                            compatibility, when namespace isn't specified in dataSourceRef,
                            both fields (dataSource and dataSourceRef) will be set to the same
                            value automatically if one of them is empty and the other is non-empty.
                            When namespace is specified in dataSourceRef,
                            dataSource isn't set to the same value and must be empty.
                            There are three important differences between dataSource and dataSourceRef:
                            * While dataSource only allows two specific types of objects, dataSourceRef
                              allows any non-core object, as well as PersistentVolumeClaim objects.
                            * While dataSource ignores disallowed values (dropping them), dataSourceRef
                              preserves all values, and generates an error if a disallowed value is
                              specified.
                            * While dataSource only allows local objects, dataSourceRef allows objects
                              in any namespaces.
                            (Beta) Using this field requires the AnyVolumeDataSource feature gate to be enabled.
                            (Alpha) Using the namespace field of dataSourceRef requires the CrossNamespaceVolumeDataSource feature gate to be enabled.
