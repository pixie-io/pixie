## Contribution Process

### Reporting Bugs and Creating Issues

Reporting bugs is one of the most helpful ways to contribute to Pixie. Bugs may be reported by filing a Github issue in the appropriate repository. For bugs regarding Pixie, file an issue in the `pixie` repo. For reporting inaccurate documentation, file an issue in the `pixie-docs` repo, etc. Please follow the template when filing an issue and provide as much information as possible.

Before reporting a bug, we encourage you to search the existing Github issues to ensure that the bug has not already been filed.

### Code Contributions

The project is still in its early stages, and we are a small team actively working on delivering our roadmap. For all changes, regardless of size, please create a Github issue that details the bug or feature being addressed before submitting a pull request. In the Github issue, contributors may discuss the viability of the solution, alternatives, and considerations.

#### Contribution Roadmap

As we are still an early-stage open source project, more changes to the contribution guidelines will follow in the coming months. We are actively working on opening our JIRA for issue tracking.
